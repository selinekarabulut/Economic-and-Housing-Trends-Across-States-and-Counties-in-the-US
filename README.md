# Shiny app to Explore Economic and Housing Trends Across States and Counties in the US (2012-2022)

I created a dashboard using the Shiny package in R software to present trends in socioeconomic indicators, demographic data, and housing values across various states and counties. This tool helps identify and visualize trends, correlations, and potential causations, enabling more informed decisions and analyses.

If interested, here is the link to the Shiny app.
